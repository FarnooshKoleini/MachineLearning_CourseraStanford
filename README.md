# MachineLearning_CourseraStanford
Useful for beginner data scientists who would like to learn machine learning! 

Hey there,
In this repository I would like to provide the answers of the machine learning course offered by Stanford University in Coursera. Do not forget that solving problems without help in the first look would be really helpful to learn the course better. However, if you need, there it is!

Cheers,
Noosh
